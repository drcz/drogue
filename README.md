drogue (dercz rogue, or Najbardziej Niebezpieczna Gra Dercza Stanis≈Çawa)

An occult (I mean magick/irena23/SiegHeilSzatan) roguelike in Polish, written in C around 2006-2008;
it's still on sourceforge but I left them when they informed me that the game will be not available from Iran, Syria and North Korea (or something equally ridiculous)...

it has some bugs (a memory leak or something) and I can't remember much about it;
only that significant part of the code was Polish declination.

I wouldn't look there anyway.
